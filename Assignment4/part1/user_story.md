User Story:

As a registered user, I can send money to a friend's PayPal account, so that I can pay them without needing cash or a bank transfer.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. When I enter my friend's email or mobile number associated with their PayPal account, the system should verify its validity before allowing the transaction.
2. The system should display a confirmation screen with the recipient's details and the amount to be sent, allowing me to review and confirm before finalizing the transaction.
3. If I have insufficient funds in my PayPal balance, the system should offer the option to draw from my linked bank account or credit card.
4. After successfully sending the money, both the sender and the recipient should receive an email or app notification confirming the transaction details.
5. The transaction history in my account should immediately reflect the sent amount with details like recipient's name, date, and purpose (if added).
